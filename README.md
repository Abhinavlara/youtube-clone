# YouTube Clone

A responsive YouTube homepage clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project demonstrates my front-end development skills — including layout design, DOM manipulation, search functionality, and component styling.  
It mimics the look and feel of YouTube's video cards and UI structure using only vanilla web technologies.

🔍 Features:
- Search filter for videos (using JS)
- Responsive layout using Flexbox
- Custom styled video cards
